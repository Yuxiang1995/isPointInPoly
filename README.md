# isPointInPoly
A fast algorithm which can determine whether a point is inside an arbitrary polygon, this method can support convex and non-convex polygon. 
It costs O(n), n refers to the n-sided shape.





Input:

point: tuple(x, y)
poly: [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]

Output:

True: inside
False: outside
